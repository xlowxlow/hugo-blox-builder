model = "PathologyVision"

# For general clinical decision support
model = "ClinicalAssistant"
```

### 3. Run the Analysis
```python
analysis = client.analyze(
    image=image_data,
    model=model,
    patient_context={
        "age": 45,
        "gender": "female",
        "clinical_history": "shortness of breath"
    }
)
```

### 4. Review Results
```python
for finding in analysis.findings:
    print(f"Finding: {finding.description}")
    print(f"Confidence: {finding.confidence:.2%}")
    print(f"Recommendation: {finding.recommendation}")
```
